**⚙️ Main API**
- Standard : This is main API response format - given a supplied base currency it will return the whole list of other currencies we support and their corresponding exchange rates. (***https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/standard-requests***)

- Pair Conversion : Submit a pair of codes and optional amount in your request. You'll get back the exchange rate between the codes and the conversion of the optional amount if you included it. (***https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/pair-conversion-requests***)
